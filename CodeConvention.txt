We adopt the "C# Coding Conventions (C# Programming Guide)":

Rules aren't in articles:
-Use Tabs instead of spaces since tabs allow developers choose their own preferences in IDE.
-Don't use LINQ/lambda expressions since this can sounds weird for non C# programmers.
-Avoid abbreviations (except those well accepted like Xml, Sqrt, etc). Code with abbreviations can be changed or even rejected without previous warning.
